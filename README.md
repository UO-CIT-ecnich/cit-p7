# Description
Reflecting on the entire project, I have gained valuable experience in creating my CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. This project allowed me to showcase my labs and projects from the CIT 281 class and demonstrate my proficiency in working with GitHub repos.

In Part 3, I created the main GitHub Page for my portfolio. I followed the instructions in the "Getting started with GitHub Pages" guide to create a user-level entry Page or an organization-level Page. I selected a theme for each Page and updated the _config.yml file to reflect the purpose of my portfolio. I replaced the initial README.md file with a list of each CIT 281 lab and project, including a brief description of the purpose of each. To enhance the visual appeal of the Page, I added images, either my own or from a free online source.

Moving on to Part 4, I created separate repos for each of the nine labs and seven projects of the CIT 281 class. I carefully named each repo using the suggested naming convention, such as cit281-lab1 and cit281-p1, to ensure clarity and organization.

In Part 5, I enabled a GitHub Page for each lab and project repo. I selected the same theme as the main Page to maintain consistency. For each lab and project Page, I provided significant details discussing the purpose of the lab or project, the technologies used, and the key takeaways and lessons learned. To make the Pages visually appealing and unique, I added additional images, including screen captures from the labs and projects.

In Part 6, I ensured that all my lab and project code was uploaded to the corresponding repos. I documented all my projects and uploaded the project code for each. While uploading the lab code was optional, I took the opportunity to include it as well, further enhancing the completeness of my portfolio.

Finally, in Part 7, I documented the URL of my entry GitHub Page by creating p7.txt and including the full URL.

Throughout this project, I gained experience working with GitHub repos and GitHub Pages. By creating my CIT Minor portfolio, I was able to organize and present my labs and projects effectively. This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills and accomplishments in the CIT 281 class while showcasing my ability to create visually appealing web pages. Overall, this project served as an important step in building my professional portfolio and refining my web development skills.
